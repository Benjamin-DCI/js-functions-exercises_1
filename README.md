# Functions Exercises 

## These exercises are aimed at making you more familiar with how to use functions. Print all of your results to the console.


#### 1. XO
Create a function that takes a string, checks if it has the same number of 'x's and 'o's and returns either true or false.
	
* Return a boolean value (true or false).
* The string can contain any character.
* When neither an x nor an o is in the string, return true.

Examples:
* XO("ooxx") ➞ true
* XO("xooxx") ➞ false
* XO("ooxXm") ➞ true (case insensitive)
* XO("zpzpzpp") ➞ true (returns true if no x and o)
* XO("zzoo") ➞ false

#### 2. Pie 
Create a function that determines whether or not it's possible to split a pie fairly given these three parameters:

* Total number of slices.
* Number of recipients.
* How many slices each person gets.

Example of defining the function: equalSlices(total slices, no. recipients, slices each)

Examples:
* equalSlices(11, 5, 3) ➞ false
* // 5 people x 3 slices each = 15 slices > 11 slices 

* equalSlices(8, 3, 2) ➞ true
* equalSlices(8, 3, 3) ➞ false
* equalSlices(24, 12, 2) ➞ true

#### 3. Cubed
Create a function that takes in an array of numbers and returns the sum of its cubes.
Examples: 
* sumOfCubes([1, 5, 9]) ➞ 855
* // Since 1^3 + 5^3 + 9^3 = 1 + 125 + 729 = 855
* sumOfCubes([3, 4, 5]) ➞ 216
* sumOfCubes([2]) ➞ 8
* sumOfCubes([]) ➞ 0

**Note**
If given an empty array, return 0.

#### 4. Amplify the Multiples of 4
Create a function that takes an integer and returns an array from 1 to the given number, where:

* If the number can be divided evenly by 4, amplify it by 10 (i.e. return 10 times the number).
* If the number cannot be divided evenly by 4, simply return the number.

Examples
* amplify(4) ➞ [1, 2, 3, 40]
* amplify(3) ➞ [1, 2, 3]
* amplify(25) ➞ [1, 2, 3, 40, 5, 6, 7, 80, 9, 10, 11, 120, 13, 14, 15, 160, 17, 18, 19, 200, 21, 22, 23, 240, 25]

**Notes**
The given integer will always be equal to or greater than 1.
Include the number (the number in the parameters).

#### 5. Months
Create a function that takes a number (from 1 to 12) and return its corresponding month name as a string.
* monthName(3) ➞ "March"
* monthName(12) ➞ "December"
* monthName(6) ➞ "June"

#### 6. Even Number Generator
Create a function that finds all even numbers from 1 to the given number.

Examples:
* evenNums(8) ➞ [2, 4, 6, 8]
* evenNums(4) ➞ [2, 4]
* evenNums(2) ➞ [2]

If there are no even numbers, return an empty array. 

#### 7. Dictionary
Create a function that takes in an initial word and filters out an array to contain words that start with the same letters as the initial word.

Examples
* dictionary("bu", ["button", "breakfast", "border"]) ➞ ["button"]
* dictionary("tri", ["triplet", "tries", "trip", "piano", "tree"]) ➞ ["triplet", "tries", trip"]
* dictionary("beau", ["pastry", "delicious", "name", "boring"]) ➞ []

**Notes**
* If none of the words match, return an empty array.
* Keep the filtered array in the same relative order as the original array of words.

#### 8. is a four letter word. 
Create a function that takes an array of strings. Return all words in the array that are exactly four letters.

Examples: 
* isFourLetters(["John", "James", "Jack", "Jeanne"]) ➞ ["John", "Jack"]
* isFourLetters(["Tomato", "Corn", "Lettuce"]) ➞ ["Corn"]
* isFourLetters(["Dog", "Cat", "Deer"]) ➞ ["Deer"]

#### 9. Is it Symmetrical? 
Create a function that takes a number as an argument and returns true or false depending on whether the number is symmetrical or not. A number is symmetrical when it is the same as its reverse.

Examples:
* isSymmetrical(7227) ➞ true
* isSymmetrical(12567) ➞ false
* isSymmetrical(44444444) ➞ true
* isSymmetrical(9939) ➞ false
* isSymmetrical(1112111) ➞ true
